### Publish to the internet

Setup environment (with Netlify)

2. Create Netlify account and follow [this instruction](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/11/30/how-to-deploy-next.js-sites-to-netlify/) 


Your normal workflow for publishing content, after initial setup is:

These are just some basic features for MindStone v1, many more are coming (if I find enough of interest and this will probably a premium/paid option):
- 🎯 Obsidian, Notion, VSCode Plugin 
- 🎯 Page Preview (like Obsidian Core plugin)
- 🎯 Andy Sliding pane
- 🎯 Full text search with `Cmd + K`
- 🎯 Infinite canvas for browsing through notes and connections

### Some know issues
This an early version of MindStone, which mean there are bugs and issues. Below are some known issues, that I plan to work on:
- Image link in wiki link style is not supported yet. `![[Image_link.png]]` will not work yet.  see work around below
- Graphview does not load when clicking on side-bar or click node on graphview, browser reload will refresh it state
- Graph view layout and interaction is still very rough. More UI/UX improvements are needed.
- Transclusion is not working yet.
